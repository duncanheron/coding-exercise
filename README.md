# Roman Numerals exercise

- Please timebox yourself to an hour for this exercise - we want to see code you are proud of, so spend more time if you need (just let us know)
- Make sure your commits are meaningful so we can see your thinking
- Fork this repository on GitHub, and store your code within your own fork
- Use either Ruby, Python, Node.js or PHP to program this exercise
- Use TDD to build a roman numeral generator
- Make sure to include sufficient tests to have confidence in your code
- The generator will take an integer value and return a string representation in roman numerals
- For example, `29` would return `'XXIX'`
- You don't need to worry about converting numbers above `1000` for this exercise
- A `Makefile` must be used for this exercise in order to run tests with `make test`
- The `make test` target should display the test runner output
- Update and extend this `README.md` file, ensuring it is informative, relevant and helpful
- All content within this `README.md` file is currently just an example and guide, and can be changed as you see appropriate
